# Blog Elements

Hi! I'd like to show you the building blocks I use when writing posts for this blog.

<Collapse title="Why did you make this page? Also, let's make the title of this collapsible element just way too long for testing purposes.">Several reasons. First, I use it to test changes to my blog components and develop new ones. Second, as I've worked on this blog, I've realized how much I'd appreciate other blogs that I use for inspiration having a resource like this. Not having to jump from page to page within a single blog when trying to answer the eternal question "how did they do that?" can help make taking bits and pieces of ideas from many developers' creations much easier.</Collapse>

Of course, there's *italics*, **bolding**, and the ability to combine ***both***.

I can [link](https://tailwindcss.com/) to things, talk about `code and stuff`, and give you helpful hints, too.<Hint>Did you know that you can right-click and select "Inspect Element" to look at the rendered DOM for this webpage?</Hint>

There are a few fun things I can do with text as well, like making things <s>terrible</s> <Wave content="whimsical" />, <Shaky content="anxiety-inducing" />, a little <Glitch>broken</Glitch>, or even <Corrupted length={10} />.

Next up: I've stolen some top-secret lists from Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!

### Evil Schemes

- Turn Roger into a baby
- Give all children cavities
- Make an army of bats

### Daily Schedule

1. Build a new -inator
2. Defeat Perry the Platapus
3. Take over the entire tri-state area!

When it comes to boxes of text, I've got you covered.

<Notice title="I can grab your attention with this one.">Look at me, I'm a notice body! Aren't you *so* interested?</Notice>

<Victory>Attention successfully obtained!</Victory>

Maybe don't get too carried away, though.

<Warning title="Careful!">You don't know what might happen if you make too many of these! Everything could come crashing down any second!</Warning>

<Problem title="Something went wrong">Oof, attention.exe has stopped working...</Problem>

<Quote author="Ludo" affiliation="Super Awesome Corp" source="https://github.com/LudoLogical" alwaysLeftJustify>At least quotes are still working, though. So that's good news. Hopefully we don't lose those before this demo is done. I'm not sure what I'd do without them.</Quote>

```js
// That was cool ☝️
// But now some sample code
function lorem(ipsum, dolor = 1) {
  const sit = ipsum == null ? 0 : ipsum.sit;
  dolor = sit - amet(dolor);
  return dolor;
}

function consectetur(...adipiscing) {
  const elit = adipiscing[0];
  return sed.eiusmod(elit) ? elit : [elit];
}
```
