# Blog Elements

Hi! I'd like to show you the building blocks I use when writing posts for this blog.

Of course, there's *italics*, **bolding**, and the ability to combine ***both***.

I can [link](https://tailwindcss.com/) to things and give you helpful hints, too.<Hint>Did you know that you can right-click and select "Inspect Element" to look at the rendered DOM for this webpage?</Hint>

There are a few fun things I can do with text as well, like making things <Wave content="whimsical" />, <Shaky content="anxiety-inducing" />, a little <Glitch>broken</Glitch>, or even <Corrupted length={10} />.

Next up: I've stolen some top-secret lists from Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!

### Evil Schemes

- Turn Roger into a baby
- Give all children cavities
- Make an army of bats

### Daily Schedule

1. Build a new -inator
2. Defeat Perry the Platapus
3. Take over the entire tri-state area!

When it comes to boxes of text, I've got you covered.

<Notice title="I can grab your attention with this one.">Look at me, I'm a notice body! Aren't you *so* interested?</Notice>

<Victory>Attention successfully obtained!</Victory>

Maybe don't get too carried away, though.

<Warning title="Careful!">You don't know what might happen if you make too many of these! Everything could come crashing down any second!</Warning>

<Problem title="Something went wrong">Oof, attention.exe has stopped working...</Problem>

<Quote author="Ludo" affiliation="the guy who made this site" source="https://github.com/LudoLogical" alwaysLeftJustify>At least quotes are still working, though. So that's good news. Hopefully we don't lose those before this demo is done. I'm not sure what I'd do without them.</Quote>
