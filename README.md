# Personal Website v4

My space on the internet :sparkles:

Here, you'll find my blog, my resume, details about some of my work, and a bunch of other stuff I've made like music and crossword puzzles.

## Version four?! What's changed?

The look and feel might not be that different from version three, but configuration under the hood has changed substantially.
- For one thing, this is the first iteration of my personal website to use the new [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app)! Thanks to that, I can take advantage of [React Server Components](https://www.patterns.dev/react/react-server-components) to use awesome new tools like [Bright](https://bright.codehike.org/) and dramatically reduce the hassle involved with things like database calls.
- Another major change is that I now have a blog! To fascilitate that, I've introduced a criminally underrated file format called [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) to the codebase.
- Finally, because I've added so much content to the site, the single-page approach I took in version three is no longer enough. As such, I've reorganized things a bit, both under the hood and in the UI.

## How It's Made
This website is built with the following major languages, tools, and technologies:
- TypeScript
- React.js
- Next.js
- TailwindCSS
- DaisyUI
- MDX
- Vercel

It also uses:
- `react-icons`
- `bright`
